Instructions for installation and running:
  Currently this is best done by cloning the repo in Android Studio itself.  We've been testing
  with the emulator set to being a Pixel 4 XL API 29.  This can be done by
  going to the AVD Manager -> Create Virtual Device -> Phone Category -> Pixel 4 XL and then simply hitting next.
  Some packages may need to be installed in order to use API 29.

Instructions for login:
  Usernames and password combinations:
    User: student  Password: student
    User: tutor1   Password: tutor1
    User: tutor2   Password: tutor2
    User: tutor3   Password: tutor3
    User: tutor4   Password: tutor4
    User: stutor   Password: stutor
    
   student is currently the only student account.  The tutor accounts
   are quite self explanitory.  stutor is the account for the case that
   a tutor is also a student, so that they can have access to both sets
   of features.  At present there's a known bug where pressing back at
   any of the home pages will take you back to the login page.  This is 
   something that may require a redesign of the underlying structure of
   the program and will be solved for the second iteration.
