_____________Team Section______________

2/28:
Today we had our initial meeting to plan creating the TBR app.  We created our rough draft of the
schema we'll be using for the database.  We also gave ourselves a rough idea of what the program
will look like in the nav graph.  And we decided how to divide the labor.  Ryan and Edwin will be
working together to develop the database.  Harrison will be doing the Login Activity.  Azzed will
be doing the Tutor Activity.  And Evan will be doing the Student Activity.

Evan:
3/20/2021 - 9:20

activity.  We can try implementing that later however in order to get a minimum viable product
completed I'm simplifying the layout.

3/16/2021 - 9:00
-Added activities for tutor, student, and student/tutor.
-Creating skeleton for everyone to build on.

3/16/2021 - 10:15
-Added indicators for tabs so that user knows where they're at.
-Still not sure why the labels aren't showing up for the tabs.  I'm going to leave it
for now since it's not totally necessary for a minimum viable product.
