2/28:
Today we had our initial meeting to plan creating the TBR app.  We created our rough draft of the
schema we'll be using for the database.  We also gave ourselves a rough idea of what the program
will look like in the nav graph.  And we decided how to divide the labor.  Ryan and Edwin will be
working together to develop the database.  Harrison will be doing the Login Activity.  Azzed will
be doing the Tutor Activity.  And Evan will be doing the Student Activity.
